# Coding challenge: modal

This is a self-contained coding challenge, to be able to look at some code together. The important thing is to look at the code together, and to understand your reasoning about it. Also, more important than finishing it is to think about it.

It's a small monolithic rails 7 app (with practically no features implemented in it). To participate in the challenge, please clone the repository, then go to this repository's issues, and create a copy of each one of the issues (I'm afraid you'll have to copy-paste the contents of those, since cloning does not carry the issues).

We will be looking at:

 * Code quality and design patterns
 * Code readability and clarity
 * [Self]documentation

Bonus points for making features tested (the app has test for Rspec, but you're free to choose Mintest if you prefer (it's also set up))
